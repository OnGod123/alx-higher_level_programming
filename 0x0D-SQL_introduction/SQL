This task involves performing various SQL operations on the hbtn_0c_0 database in your MySQL server. The operations include creating tables, inserting records, deleting records, and querying data. The database operations are performed using SQL scripts which can be executed via the mysql command.

Requirements
MySQL server installed and running
MySQL client (mysql command) available
A MySQL user with appropriate permissions to create databases, tables, and perform CRUD operations
Scripts
1. Create Database (if not exists)
Creates the database hbtn_0c_0 if it doesn't already exist.

sql
Copy code
-- 1-create_database_if_missing.sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hbtn_0c_0;
2. Create second_table and Insert Records
Creates a table called second_table in the hbtn_0c_0 database and inserts multiple rows. If the table already exists, the script will not fail.

sql
Copy code
-- 2-create_and_insert_second_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hbtn_0c_0.second_table (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(256),
    score INT
);

INSERT INTO hbtn_0c_0.second_table (id, name, score) VALUES
(1, 'John', 10),
(2, 'Alex', 3),
(3, 'Bob', 14),
(4, 'George', 8);
3. List All Rows with a Score >= 10
Lists all rows from the second_table where the score is greater than or equal to 10, ordered by score in descending order. Results display both the score and the name.

sql
Copy code
-- 3-list_high_scores.sql
SELECT score, name
FROM hbtn_0c_0.second_table
WHERE score >= 10
ORDER BY score DESC;
4. Remove Records with a Score <= 5
Removes all records from the second_table where the score is less than or equal to 5.

sql
Copy code
-- 4-remove_low_scores.sql
DELETE FROM hbtn_0c_0.second_table
WHERE score <= 5;
5. Count Records by Score
Lists the number of records with the same score in the second_table, displaying the score and the count. The list is sorted by the number of records in descending order.

sql
Copy code
-- 5-count_records_by_score.sql
SELECT score, COUNT(*) AS number
FROM hbtn_0c_0.second_table
GROUP BY score
ORDER BY number DESC;
Usage
Create Database (if not exists):

sh
Copy code
cat 1-create_database_if_missing.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p
Create second_table and Insert Records:

sh
Copy code
cat 2-create_and_insert_second_table.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0
List All Rows with a Score >= 10:

sh
Copy code
cat 3-list_high_scores.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0
Remove Records with a Score <= 5:

sh
Copy code
cat 4-remove_low_scores.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0
Count Records by Score:

sh
Copy code
cat 5-count_records_by_score.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0
When prompted, enter the MySQL root user's password.

Notes
Ensure that the MySQL server is running and accessible.
Replace 'root' and 'your_password' with the appropriate MySQL username and password.
These scripts are designed to be run from the command line in a Unix-like environment.
